<h2>Breed History</h2>
<p>seawater constitutes a rich source of various commercially important chemical elements.
    Much of the world’s magnesium is recovered from seawater, as are large quantities of bromine.
    In certain parts of the world, sodium chloride (table salt) is still obtained by evaporating seawater.
    In addition, water from the sea, when desalted, can furnish a limitless supply of drinking water.
    Many large desalination plants have been built in dry areas along seacoasts in the Middle East and elsewhere to relieve shortages of fresh water.</p>
